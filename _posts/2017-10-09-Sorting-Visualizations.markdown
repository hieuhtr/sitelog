Okay, I don't even know... Quick sort is a pretty famous sorting algorithm, especially because of how good it is at combining a lot of ideas that new programming students need to learn into one magical unicorn of science. This algorithm is a recursive algorithm, which means it's a bit of code that runs itself over and over. Each time it breaks down what it's doing into smaller pieces and saying "okay, now lets do the exact same thing to those smaller pieces, and we can totally break those down too into even smaller pieces!!".

That's really the whole idea behind quick sort. It takes a value (for this example, I just told it to choose the value on the far left of where it's looking", and go "okay, everything smaller than this on the left, everything larger than this on the right.", then you have that single value sorted exactly where it goes, and two halves of mostly unsorted values that definitely go somewhere in their section. Then it'll look at the left half and do the same thing, pi...
