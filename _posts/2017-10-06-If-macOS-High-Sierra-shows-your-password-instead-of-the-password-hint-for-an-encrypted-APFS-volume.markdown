If macOS High Sierra shows your password instead of the password hint for an encrypted APFS volume

Take steps to protect your data if you see your password instead of your password hint for an encrypted APFS volume.

Your password might be displayed instead of your password hint if you used the Add APFS Volume command in Disk Utility to create an encrypted APFS volume, and you supplied a password hint.
