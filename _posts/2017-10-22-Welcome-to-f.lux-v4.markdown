f.lux development is supported by people like you.  Click here to send us $10 to support our work. Thank you!  This new version of f.lux adapts to your schedule with a super-strong “bedtime mode” that ramps up when your body needs less blue light, and it has tons of new features and better performance too.  There’s one important thing you have to do to make this work.

While you can use a gentler setting to relieve eyestrain, it might not affect your sleep as much as you expect–they’re two different things. To explain the difference, we’re bringing numbers about how light affects your body right into the app, so you can pick the right settings for you.  New in this version (...
