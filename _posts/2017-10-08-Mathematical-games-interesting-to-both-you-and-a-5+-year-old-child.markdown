There is an infinite indexed family of family-friendly, $\geq2$-player, perfect-information, draw-free-if-finite, cheap-to-construct, two-player combinatorial1, solved, sequential games, which are easily formalizable, have considerable mathematical substance, easily suggest open problems (both in the direction of exact analyses feasible even for children, and in the direction of inventing mathematically-informed heuristics) and have connections to classical graph theory (from any given position, solving 'find a maximum matching' is sufficient to decide who has a winning strategy from this position). They seem to fit the

Question: Do you have some experience/proposals of "games" which you can play with your children, which would be on the one hand would make some fun for them, on the other would somehow develop their logical/thinking/mathematical skills, and on the other hand would be of at least some interest for adult mathematicians ?

Thinking about it, I agree that 'Set' gives a ch...
