Today we are excited to announce the public availability of HashiCorp Consul 1.0. Consul is a tool for service discovery and runtime configuration for distributed applications and infrastructure. Consul joins Vagrant and Packer as the third HashiCorp product to reach the 1.0 milestone.  The product has added significant functionality since it was released in April 2014 and today is used on millions of machines across many of the world's largest companies like SAP, Comcast, and Citadel. Consul 1.0 highlights include HCL configuration files and many smaller improvements, fixes, and cleaned up interfaces. Consul 1.0 Enterprise is highlighted by Sentinel integration to enforce policies on Consul's key/value store and service registration.  For more information on Consul Enterprise visit https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul/.  You can find the full list of changes in all Consul releases leading up to 1.0 in the Changelog. There are a number of breaking changes in this release, so pleas...
